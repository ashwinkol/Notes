# Data Types And Literals

This project provides an overview of Java data types, literals, operators, defining classes, and access modifiers. It aims to serve as a reference for beginners and intermediate Java developers.

## Data Types and Literals

Java supports various data types such as integer, floating-point, character, boolean, etc. Data literals represent constant values in code. Understanding data types and literals is fundamental for programming in Java.

## Operators in Java

Operators in Java are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. These include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), relational operators (==, !=, >, <), logical operators (&&, ||, !), etc. Knowing how to use operators effectively is crucial for manipulating data in Java programs.

## Defining Classes

In Java, classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming. A class is a blueprint for creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior. Defining classes involves declaring attributes (fields) and methods that describe the behavior of objects.

## Access Modifiers

Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and other members within Java programs. There are four access modifiers: public, private, protected, and default (no modifier). Understanding access modifiers is essential for designing secure and maintainable Java code.
